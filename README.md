# Factorio-Lua

Factorio uses a [custom version](https://github.com/Rseding91/Factorio-Lua) of Lua that disables `package.*`, `os.*`, `io.*`, `load*` and uses the C++ compiler.

Here all these components are returned to their place and the C compiler is used again.

Also added a project file for [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/).
